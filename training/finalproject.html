    <p> Fresh fish rapidly deteriorates unless some way can be found to preserve it.
    <p> <strong>Drying</strong> is a method of food preservation that works by removing water from the food, which inhibits the growth of microorganisms.</p>
    <p>Fish are preserved through such traditional methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <p><li>drying</li></p> 
        <p><li>smoking</li></p>
        <p><li>salting</li></p>
    </ul>
    
    <p> The oldest traditional way of preserving fish was to let the wind and sun dry it.</p>
    <p> Drying food is the world's oldest known preservation method, and dried fish has a storage life of several years.</p>
    <p> The method is cheap and effective in suitable climates; the work can be done by the fisherman and family, and the resulting product is easily transported to market.</p>
